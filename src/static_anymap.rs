// SAFETY:
// From the rustonomicon:
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html
// "A type is Sync if it is safe to share between threads (T is Sync if and only if &T is Send)."
// All accessors are only implemented for 'static references, so I believe we can say &T ('static
// implied) is Send. And since any mutation is guarded by a RwLock, the type should be sync too.
//
// I'm a bit uncertain about the above. I've managed to limit access to the inner AnyMap via
// 'static references, but there's nothing stopping a user from creating a non-'static
// StaticAnyMap. The impl below allows to send it between threads, even if the type is not
// 'static. This instance would be unusable but perhaps it can still trigger UB. For example in
// the following podcast at ~14:10, Andrew Kelly mentions the existence of a dangling pointer
// might cause undefined behaviour:
// https://rustacean-station.org/episode/andrew-kelley/
// I'm concerned that, similar to the dangling pointer example, the existence of a struct that is
// shared across thread boundaries which shouldn't already triggers UB regardless of whether it's
// actually accessed.
